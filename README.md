# Wikipedia Viewer

A website that lets users search for articles on Wikipedia or generate random ones. Built using HTML, CSS, jQuery and the Wikipedia API. This project was part of my efforts to earn freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Certification and therefore follows the user stories outlined [here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-wikipedia-viewer).
